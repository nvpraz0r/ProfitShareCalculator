# 
# ideas:
# - CLI interface doesn't need to be fancy
# - Prompt user for various data points
#   - cash close out, credit card close out, product costs; you get the idea
# - Once all the data has been confirmed generate a CSV file or excel spreadsheet
# 

# 
# REFER TO example.txt
# 
# data structure planning:
#
# data = [
# ("cash close out", 1234),
# ("credit card close out", 4321),
# ("total product costs", 1234),
# ("returned meat", 12),
# ("profit shared", 200)
# ]
